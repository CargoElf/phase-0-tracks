<!--

1. HTML5 semantic tags help keep a page's code organized. They help someone coming in and looking at the code for the first time to decipher what's going on quickly. I see the header, footer, nav, and possibly main as especially useful.

2. Unless I'm misunderstanding the question, the browser displays elements from the HTML from top to bottom unless the CSS changes the layout/order. 

3. I learned that I can create custom snippets in Sublime. I can see using this in the future after gaining a greater understanding of HTML5 and CSS.

4. I suppose the concept that was the most difficult for me was what element to use for what content. I'll be improving my understanding through practice and the use of the HTML5 flow chart.
