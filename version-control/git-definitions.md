# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version control is having several versions of the same code or file and records of the changes over time. It is useful because you can create different versions of the file/code without affecting the master branch. You can revert to an older version in case of any mistakes as well.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

Branches are points in time where you break off of the master code to work on parts of the code without affecting the master.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit is when you actually save/make the changes to the file to whatever branch it is on. A good commit message is descriptive and explains what you changed.

* What is a merge conflict?

A merge conflict happens when there is an issue with merging branches. It can happen if there is code conflicting with eachother in the same line.
