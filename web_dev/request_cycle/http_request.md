2. What is the difference between a GET request and a POST request? When might each be used?

Get request - Requests a representation of a specified recourse. It shouldn't be sued for operations that cause side-effects.

Post - submits data to be processed to an identified resource. Best used when updating or creating new resources.

3. Optional bonus question: What is a cookie (the technical kind, not the delicious kind)? How does it relate to HTTP requests?

A small piece of data sent from a website and stored in the user's browser while the user is browsing. It can be used to store information like what's in a user's shopping cart, authenticate user logins and track what sites a user has visited.
