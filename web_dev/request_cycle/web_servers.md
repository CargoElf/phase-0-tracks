1. What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?

Teat all users with respect.
Expect the user is computer literate
Provide the user with complete control


2. In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?

A virtual machine that is run on a host. The virtual server can then have an os installed on it and is given resources to simulate different setups, such as amount of memory and processing power.

The advantages of using a vps is the ability to experiment with different changes and configurations with the ability to destroy copies that don't work out. VPS also gives more control and is easy to scale as needed.

3. Optional bonus question: Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?

The root user has full permissions and thus all programs have root access. When run at a user level, it's possible to access root privileges through the sudo command so there's no need run with that access at all moments.
