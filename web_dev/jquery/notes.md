# The Plan
* Find overview of what jQuery does well
* Find a brief intro tutorial
* Checkout W3 schools/docs
* Try to replicate previous project with jQuery
* Take a 5 minute stand up and walk around break every half hour or so.
* Test simple things research, then go on to more complex

#Notes
I started by running through some CodeCadamy to get the basics of the syntax. After that I read through a W3 tutorial and started to realize that I needed some focus as to what I was trying to do. Trying to learn it all isn't focused enough for two hours. At that point, I started to build something just to test ideas and try to hone in on the strong points of jQuerry. I realized that recreating what I've previously done wasn't necessarily the best way forward. For my make a thing I will refine and try to push things in a more difficult direction.
